# Embedde-Smart-Door-Lock-System-

The goal of this project is to research and analyze a suitable collection of 
components for developing a smart door lock using Arduino that provides 
excellent security and quick access. The following are the specific project goals:
● Familiarity with a smart door locking system based on a microcontroller.
● Using Arduino to create a simple and smart door locking system

The estimated cost of our project products is given below(Approximately),
● 1 Arduino Board = 400 TK 
● 1 4×3 Matrix Keypad = 100 TK
● 1 PWM Powered Servo Motor= 450 TK
● 1 16×2 LCD Display = 180 TK
● 2 LED Light = 5 TK
